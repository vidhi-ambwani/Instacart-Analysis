## Overview of Instacart 
Insta cart is a company that helps people get groceries from multiple stores like Wegmanâ€™s, Costco, Walmart and more without even leaving the house.

## Steps performed
Utilized a dataset sourced from Kaggle as the foundation for my analysis. Leveraging Python, conducted comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure accuracy and derive valuable insights. Additionally, constructed interactive Tableau dashboards to visually represent these insights, enabling a more intuitive understanding of the data patterns and facilitating informed decision-making processes.
